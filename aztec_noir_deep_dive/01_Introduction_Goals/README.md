## 1. Session Introduction & Goals ðŸŽ¯

*(This is where you set the tone for your session)*

**Welcome, everyone, to our deep dive into Aztec and Noir!**

Today is about embarking on a challenging but incredibly rewarding journey. Our motto here is **"Do Hard Things,"** and the world of Zero-Knowledge proofs and privacy-preserving blockchains is certainly that. But it's also where the most impactful innovations in Web3 are happening.

**What is "Programmable Digital Money"?**
The document you read (referred to as "TL;DR" from here) states:
> Blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum provide humanity with programmable digital money. By programmable digital money, we mean that users can:
> * Program what digital money represents...
> * Define its properties and behavior...
> * Ensure that money follows the rules... (without relying on a trusted third party!)

This is powerful. But there's a missing piece.

**Aztec's Mission:**
> Aztec is a privacy-first Layer 2 on Ethereum. It enables a critical dimension of programmable digital money that has heretofore been ignored: **privacy**.
>
> To be more specific, Aztec is a zk-rollup providing humanity with privacy-preserving programmable digital money. Its privacy preserving properties mean that users can choose which information stays private and which information goes public, enabling use-cases such as private identity, private transactions, and private smart-contracts. (Source: TL;DR)

**Our Goals for Today's Session:**

* **Understand the WHY:** Grasp the critical need for privacy on public blockchains.
* **Understand the WHAT:** Get a clear, high-level understanding of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and how Aztec Network uses them as a Layer 2 solution.
* **Understand the HOW (Past & Present):**
    * Explore the foundational ideas from Aztec's original 2018 whitepaper.
    * Dive into the architecture of the modern Aztec network (PXE, Kernel, State models).
* **Understand the BUILD:** Get introduced to Noir, the language for writing Aztec smart contracts, and the Aztec SDK for interacting with them.
* **Get INSPIRED:** See how these tools can be used to build private dApps and feel empowered to start your own journey of "Doing Hard Things" in the ZK space.

This session will be dense. We'll cover a lot of ground. Don't worry about memorizing everything today. The goal is to build a strong mental map. These notes will be your reference. Ask questions, engage, and let's explore this exciting frontier together!

Our guiding example throughout will be a **"Private Community DAO & Fund"** â€“ imagine Web3Clubs Kenya building its own decentralized, private organization.
