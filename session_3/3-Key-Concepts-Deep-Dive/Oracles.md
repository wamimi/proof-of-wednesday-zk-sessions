# Key Concept: Oracles (in Aztec)

In the broader blockchain world, an "oracle" is typically a service that brings external, real-world data (like the price of BTC/USD) onto the public blockchain. In Aztec, the term **Oracle Call** refers to something more specific and fundamental to how private execution works: it's a mechanism for a private function, during proof generation, to request information from the user's local Private Execution Environment (PXE).

**Analogy: Consulting Your Notes During an Exam**

Imagine you are taking a very difficult, closed-book exam (`#[private]` function execution). The exam room is isolated and secure (the ZK-proof environment). However, the exam proctor (the Aztec protocol) allows you a special privilege: at certain points, you can raise your hand and ask your personal tutor (the **PXE**), who is waiting right outside the door, for a specific piece of information from your private notebook.

-   You can't ask for the final answer.
-   You can only ask for specific data points you need to solve the problem.
-   The proctor doesn't see the information on your notes; they only see you asking the question and receiving an answer. The information goes directly into your exam paper (the witness for the ZK-proof).

This is exactly what an oracle call is in Aztec. It's a secure communication channel between a private circuit being proved and the user's wallet, which holds all the secret information.

## How Do Oracle Calls Work?

When the Noir compiler encounters an oracle call function inside a `#[private]` function, it embeds a special instruction into the circuit. When the PXE executes this circuit to generate a proof, it sees this instruction and pauses the execution. It then provides the requested information, and the circuit execution resumes with this new information included as a private input.

## Examples from Our Tutorials

We have already seen two major examples of oracle calls:

1.  **`context.request_nsk_app(...)`** (from the Private Voting contract)
    -   **The Question:** "Hey PXE, I need the secret Nullifier Spending Key (NSK) that is associated with this application and this user. I need it to generate a unique nullifier so this user can't vote twice."
    -   **The Answer:** The PXE provides the secret key, which is used inside the `cast_vote` function to create the nullifier.

2.  **`get_auth_witness(&mut context, payload.hash())`** (from the Account Abstraction contract)
    -   **The Question:** "Hey PXE, I need an authentication witness. Please take this transaction payload hash, sign it with the user's authentication private key, and give me the resulting signature."
    -   **The Answer:** The PXE (via the `AuthWitnessProvider`) provides the Schnorr signature, which is then used inside the `is_valid_impl` function to verify the transaction's authenticity.

Another common example is fetching private notes: when you want to make a transfer, an oracle call is used to ask the PXE, "Which of my private notes can I use to cover this amount?" The PXE provides the necessary notes to be consumed in the transaction.

## Why are Oracles Necessary for Privacy?

Oracles are the bridge that makes private dApps practical. Private functions need access to secrets to do their workâ€”secrets that cannot be passed in as public function arguments or stored in public state. Oracle calls provide a secure and standardized way for a circuit to say, "I have reached a point where I need secret information X," allowing the user's own machine to privately inject that secret into the proof, keeping it shielded from the public network.
